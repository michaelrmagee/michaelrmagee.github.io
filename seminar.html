<div class="optc"> In this talk I will discuss about models of random unitary matrices of large size. Considering r matrices of size N,  this can be thought of as a random, N dimensional, unitary representation of the free group of rank r, and leads to a random state on the group algebra of the free group. Since the seminal work of Voiculescu in the 90’s, it is well established that independent, uniform unitary matrices are asymptotically, freely independent: the latter random state converges weakly, in probability towards the character of the regular representation of the free group, as N goes to infinity. 
<br>
On Friday, I will consider models of unitary matrices which are not independent,  but with conditions on their commutators.  I will review recent results of M. Magee on the so called Atiyah-Bott-Goldman measure — a model of random unitary representation of surface groups — and of two recent joint works of myself with T. Lemoine about the Yang-Mills measure on surfaces, which can be thought of as a model  interpolating between Voiculescu’s and Atiyah-Bott-Goldman’s settings. For the torus, the latter joint works lead to a new interpolation between classical and free independence.

The result allows to approximate at scale 1 the n-step distribution of the walk by the time n of a smooth diffusion process for a new group structure on G. We also show this approximation is robust under deviation. The proof uses a Gaussian replacement scheme, combining Fourier analysis and a swapping argument inspired by the work of Diaconis-Hough. As a consequence, we obtain a probabilistic version of Ratner's theorem: Ad-unipotent random walks on finite-volume homogeneous spaces equidistribute toward algebraic measures.

<div class="optc">Conformal Bootstrap is an active area of research in theoretical physics, which aims to constrain a subclass of quantum field theories starting only from a set of basic self-consistency conditions. In this talk I will review the relation between this program and the spectral theory of hyperbolic manifolds. As I will show, hyperbolic manifolds (orbifolds, more generally) provide solutions to the self-consistency equations used in conformal bootstrap. Furthermore, a direct application of standard conformal bootstrap techniques leads to strong constraints on the spectral gap of hyperbolic 2-orbifolds, which is in many cases nearly saturated by known surfaces. I will also mention some new results from an ongoing work. Based on https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12716 and work in progress with James Bonifacio, Dalimil Mazac and Sridip Pal.

On the one hand they have some good algorithmic properties, e.g. solvable word problem, but pathological examples abound, and they have therefore been resistant to most of the geometric tools we have available - for instance, small cancellation theory tells us nothing. I will relate the subgroup structure of a one-relator group \(G \) to the primitivity rank, a notion introduced by Puder, \( \pi(w) \) of \( w \), in his work on word maps in free groups. Our results seem to provide a conceptual explanation for some strong analogies between one-relator groups on the one hand and surface and three-manifold groups on the other.

Unfortunately, it is not easy to compute expectations and probabilities in this probabilistic setting. We are only able to compute expectations of quantities that depend on lengths of *simple* closed geodesics, i.e. geodesics with no self-intersections, thanks to breakthrough work by Mirzakhani. The aim of this talk is to present new ideas that allow to deal with non-simple geodesics, developed in an ongoing collaboration with Nalini Anantharaman. We show that certain averages can be expanded in powers of 1/g and provide information on the terms appearing in this expansion. I will discuss the implications of these results in spectral geometry, and the inspiration we found in Friedman's work on random regular graphs.

If the Cheeger constant of a manifold is large, then, through Cheeger's inequality, this implies that Laplacian of the manifold has a large spectral gap. In this talk, I will discuss how large Cheeger constants of hyperbolic surfaces can be. I will discuss recent joint work with Thomas Budzinski and Nicolas Curien in which we prove that the Cheeger constant of a closed hyperbolic surface of large genus cannot be much larger than 2/pi (approximately 0.6366). This in particular proves that there is a uniform gap between the maximal possible Cheeger constant of a hyperbolic surface of large enough genus and the Cheeger constant of the hyperbolic plane (which is equal to 1).

<div class="optc">The shape of the spectrum of the Laplacian on a geometrically finite hyperbolic manifold \( M = \Gamma \backslash \mathbb{H}^{d+1} \)
  is closely connected to the size of the critical exponent \(\delta\) of \(\Gamma\). In particular, results of Patterson, Sullivan, and Lax-Phillips imply that when \(\delta > \frac{d}{2}\), the base eigenfunction is square integrable, and the corresponding eigenvalue is isolated in the \(L^2\) spectrum. These facts allow one to use tools from representation theory to study dynamics on \(M\). On the other hand, when \(\delta\) is at most \(\frac{d}{2}\), one knows that \( L^2 ( \mathrm{SO}^o(d+1,1) ) \) is a tempered representation of \(\mathrm{SO}^o(d+1,1) \). I will discuss joint work with Hee Oh in which we investigate to what extend these properties hold for higher-rank infinite volume locally symmetric spaces. In particular, I will introduce the growth indicator function, a higher-rank analogue of the critical exponent, and discuss the role it plays in dynamics on higher-rank infinite volume homogeneous spaces.

<div class="optc">For hyperbolic surfaces, there is a deep connection between the geometry of closed geodesics and their spectral theoretic properties. In this talk, I will discuss recent work with Will Hide (Durham), where we study both sides of this relationship for hyperbolic punctured spheres. In particular, we consider Weil-Petersson random surfaces and demonstrate Poisson statistics for counting functions of closed geodesics with lengths on scales 1/sqrt(number of cusps), in the large cusp regime. Using similar ideas, we show that typical hyperbolic punctured spheres with many cusps have lots of arbitrarily small eigenvalues. Throughout, I will contrast these findings to the setting of closed hyperbolic surfaces in the large genus regime.

Let \( \Gamma \) be a discrete group equipped with some length function. Given a finite index subgroup \(\Gamma'\), and a coset \(x\) in \(\Gamma/\Gamma'\), the lifting problem is to find a lift of \(x\) to \(\Gamma\) of small length.<br>
It turns out that this problem is closely related to spectral problems, and in particular, an optimal spectral gap leads to an "optimal lifting" for almost all \(x\).
When \(\Gamma\) is a free group, the problem translates into bounding the "almost diameter" of a certain Schreier graph, and this question was studied by Sardari and Lubetzky-Peres. When \(\Gamma\) is arithmetic and \(\Gamma'\) is a congruence subgroup, the spectral gap is related to the Generalized Ramanujan Conjecture from automorphic forms, and this question was studied by Gorodnik-Nevo.<br>
In general, getting the optimal spectral gap is either hopelessly hard or simply false. I will describe how one may relax the strong spectral gap condition, following the work of Sarnak and Xue.

<div class="optc">Rajchman measures (i.e. measures with decaying Fourier transform at infinity) have emerged in the historical study of sets of uniqueness and multiplicity for trigonometric series. Over the recent years, it has become an active topic to study Rajchman measures defined by groups or dynamical systems such as stationary measures or Gibbs equilibrium states. Roughly speaking stationarity allows one to study the measure using ”discretised word distributions” given by products of group elements or products of derivatives of the map defining the dynamical system. As such, given enough non-linearity of the dynamics (or ”non-concentration” in the group), using multiplicative energy this discretised word distribution must exhibit multiplicative structure at a positive proportion of scales. Then by the discretised sum-product phenomenon, such distributions cannot simultaneously have additive structure, which, using additive energy can be translated for them to have small Fourier coefficients. In this talk we will attempt to give a gentle and general introduction to this field and the methods, and outline some future challenges.
